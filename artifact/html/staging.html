<h2>creative brief</h2>
<ol>
	<li><h4>title</h4>
		<p>What's in Our Solar System?</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>project summary</h4>
		<p>l hope my site can become a good tool for explaining the basics of the solar system and get the audience interested in planets besides ours, as well as in astronomy in general. The scope of the information I am planning on including may vary, but will at the very least include information on each planet's distance from the sun, distinguishing features and geological composition.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>audience profile</h4>
		<p>Children in 5th-6th grade and up; possibly 3rd grade and up. But I'd like to aim the site at a more general audience too, aside from children, so that anyone can use this as a resource regardless of age or background.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>perception and tone</h4>
		<p>Astronomy is a vast field, and space even more so. I'd like the tone to be friendly and easy to engage with, so the solar system doesn't seem so daunting. At the same time, I'd like the audience to get a feel for how vast and impressive the world outside ours can be like, and be excited to learn more.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>communication system</h4>
		<p>I will be using a simple multi-page site, possibly vertically scrolling. Viewers will be able to click back and forth between different planets to compare them; on hover (if possible to code with CSS) information regarding the atmosphere (when applicable) and composition of a planet will be displayed. For mobile, this might display with a click. The site's visuals should make viewers feel as if they are exploring through space; an image of a rocket moving with the scroll may help for this.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h4>target message</h4>
		<p>I want my audience to leave the site knowing a bit more about our solar system and how unique the Earth really is (and how lucky we are). I hope they will be interested enough after this brief introduction to research further into astronomy.</p>
